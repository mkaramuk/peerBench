This function has many convenient properties: Marginal products of both labor and capital are positive if \\beta and \\gamma are. If \\beta + \\gamma = 1, the function has constant returns to scale. That is, if both inputs are increased in like proportion, output will increase in that same proportion. A doubling of both inputs, for example, will result in doubled output. Discuss how the concept of linear regression might be applied to estimate \\beta and \\gamma .\n\nA: Polynomial regression\nB: Linear progression\nC: Quantile regression\nD: Ridge regression\nE: Logistic regression\nF: Exponential regression\nG: Lasso regression\nH: Multiple regression\nI: Single regression\nJ: Non-linear regression\n",
