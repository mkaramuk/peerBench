Explain how prices can act as 'feedback mechanism' to offset the depletion of resources?\n\nA: The price system helps allocative efficiency by identifying the cheapest production processes and reallocating resources. It also acts as a feedback mechanism by inducing consumers to economize on scarce resources and seek alternatives.\nB: The price system only affects the demand side of the market\nC: The price system hinders allocative efficiency by creating market imbalances\nD: The price system allocates resources based on government directives rather than market forces\nE: The price system promotes allocative efficiency by maintaining constant prices, thus ignoring the scarcity or abundance of resources\nF: The price system ensures equal distribution of resources regardless of demand and supply\nG: The price system helps allocative efficiency by fixing prices at a standard rate, preventing any feedback mechanism\nH: The price system encourages allocative efficiency by decreasing consumer demand through higher prices, without providing a feedback mechanism for resource depletion\nI: The price system has no impact on allocative efficiency and serves only to generate profits for businesses\nJ: The price system promotes allocative efficiency by increasing production costs\n",
